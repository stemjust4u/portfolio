This website is my attempt to document, in one location, STEM concepts I hope to incorporate in a Maker space some day. It contains tutorials and links to resources useful for learning STEM, with a focus on Raspberry Pi (and other Linux distros), Scratch, Python, javascript, and circuits. It is meant to be a reference tool and not a step-by-step guide. If you are interested in STEM and Linux, and want to learn more in those areas, then hopefully the information here will be useful.

My background is in engineering. I worked in semiconductor manufacturing and the computer science classes I took in college proved to be the most useful in my career. Those experiences grew an interest I've always had in STEM. I have learned a lot in the process and enjoy sharing that info with others. A large portion of the material on the site come from key resources I've learned from including wiki, stackexchange, w3schools, freecodecamp, etc.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. --->
